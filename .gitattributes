# See GITATTRIBUTES(5) (``man gitattributes``).
# - ``diff=<language>`` declares that diff hunk headers and git-diff word diffs
#   (for ``git diff --word-diff`` and ``git diff --color-words``) should be
#   specially computed for the language grammar.  This makes git-diff more
#   powerful and useful.
